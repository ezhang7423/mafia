# Deploying the mafia codebase

Since our app conforms with a default next.js configuration, it's super simple to deploy. In this tutorial we'll show you how to deploy to heroku.
(NOTE: we assume that you already have a heroku account).
* Step 0. "Fork this project repo to your own personal GitHub account by clicking on the 'Fork' button at the upper right hand of the repo's page on GitHub.  This creates a personal copy of the repo under your own GitHub account.  This is necessary because you can't deploy an app to Heroku unless you have admin access to the repo." (Quoted from Professor Conrad)
* Step 1. Go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
* Step 2. Create a new app from the top left
* Step 3. Name the app whatever you want (e.g. mmafiaa). Click on create new app, as you can leave
 everything else as default. 
* Step 4. Click on Github for Deployment Method, and then link the repository under your personal account. Try searching for "project-s2-t4-mafia". Click on connect once you find it.
* Click on deploy branch! You should be finshed.
